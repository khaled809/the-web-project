    <p>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use,
        maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and,
        in some cases, entertainment to spectators. Sports can, through casual or organized participation,
        improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants,
        through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants,
        either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing,
        many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner;
        in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other.
        Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; 
        others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser.
        A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.
        Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, 
        followed in some cases by playoffs.
    </p>
    
    <p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, 
        with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.
        Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.
        However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports.
        The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, 
        and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, 
        chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.
    </p>
   
   
    <p>Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, 
        and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. 
        Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. 
        It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, 
        including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.

    <div id="h_1" class="hide">
    <p>The word "sport" comes from the Old French desport meaning "leisure", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything humans find amusing or entertaining".
        Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.
        Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation

    <h3 onclick="show('h_2')" class="suph">Nomenclature</h3>
    <div id="h_2" class="hide">
    <p>The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England").
         American English uses "sports" for both terms.</p>
